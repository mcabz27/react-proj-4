##What it is and why?
####This app is designed to make the process of deciding where to go out with friends a little less stressfull. Midways simply gets the address that is in the middle between you and the friend you are meeting.

##Problems Faced
* Getting a map to actually render on the page was difficult at first.
    * With the help of a tutorial (https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-write-a-google-maps-react-component/), pre-built react google maps components (https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps), and the npm module react-google-maps maps were getting rendered on the page.

##Used
* React
* React-Router
* React-Google-Maps
* Bootstrap
